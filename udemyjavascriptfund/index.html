    <h1>JS fundamentals from Udemy Course</h1>

    <h5>Important Terms:</h5>

    <h6>Syntax Parser</h6>
    <h6>Lexical Environment</h6>
    <h6>Execution Context</h6>

    <hr>

    <h6>Global Environment (Global Execution Context)(Wraps Code)</h6>
    <p>Creates a global object, and variable this</p>
    <p>Attaches variable and function to global object(window and this)</p>
    <p>Global Object<p>

    <hr>
    <h6>Hoisting</h6>
    <p>Setups Memory Space for Variables and Functions, so when code runs it already exist within the system.</p>
    <p>Variables are treated slightly different. Compiler will setup memory space for A, but won't know what the actual value is until is runs line by line.</p>
    <!-- b();
    console.log(a);
    
        var a = "Hello World!";
    
        function b ( ) {
            console.log("Called B!")
        }; -->
    <hr>
    <h6>Undefined</h6>
    <p>A special variable inside Javascript that means variable has not been set</p>
    <p>All variables get undefiend during the first initial phase of creation unless initialized ot something else</p>

    <hr>
    <h6>Single Threaded & Synchrouns Execution</h6>
    <p>One command being executed at a time</p>
    <p>SingleThread = javascript behaves in a singlethreaded matter</p>
    <p>Synchrounus, code being executed one line at a time.</p>

    <hr>

    <h6>Invocation and Execution Stack</h6>
    <p>Create global context for all functions and variables. Then code is executed</p>
    <p>() = invoking, and a new execution context is created, and placed ontop of execution stack</p>
    <p>It will have its own space for variables and function. Then execute code line by line. If another function is inovked. It's gonna stop
        at that line of code, and create another execution context. Then run that code, until its POPPED off the stack.
    </p>

// console.log(a);

    var a;

    if ( a === undefined ) {
        console.log('a is undefined!')
    } else {
        console.log('a is defined!')
    }

    function b ( ) {
        console.log("Called B!")
